- **Radix UI & shadcn/ui**: For a consistent UI component library.
- **React Query**: For server state management.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling with a comprehensive design system supporting light/dark themes.
- **React Hook Form with Zod**: For type-safe form handling and validation.
- **Replit Auth**: User authentication with Google, GitHub, X, Apple, and email/password via `useAuth` hook.

## Backend
The backend is an Express.js application with TypeScript, designed with an API-first approach. It features:
- **Express.js**: As the server framework.
- **Drizzle ORM**: For PostgreSQL database integration.
- **Replit Auth**: OpenID Connect authentication with session management, user upsert, and protected routes via `isAuthenticated` middleware.

- **RESTful API**: Endpoints for managing providers, vehicles, city tours, bookings, and homepage content.
- **Zod**: For request body validation.

## Component Structure
The application is organized into layout, feature, admin, page, and UI components. Key administrative features include:
- **Admin Interface**: Tabs for managing providers, vehicles (with 8 types and seasonal/hourly pricing), city tours (modern 3-step creation with live preview, visual selectors, highlight composer), and homepage content.
